## Introduction

The Food Information Encyclopedia is where you can find information about all kinds of food. This is managed by a java spring system. Out task is to implement a feedback service for collecting and storing user feedback about the services that we provide.

## Overview

The web client is a react web app. The web app communicates with the backend which is build from a micro services architecture. The composition of the services are managed by docker-compose.

The food-service retrieves data about the foods which are stored in a JSON file. The service exposes a REST api for querying the food data. 

The feedback service stores feedback in a sqlite database. The service exposes a REST API which is implemented in Express.JS.

We also added an API gateway which all communication between frontend and the client should go through. This way the micro services are not directly exposed outside of docker-compose.
