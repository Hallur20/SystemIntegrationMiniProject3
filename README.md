## Introduction

The Food Information Encyclopedia is now also selling food. This is managed by a legacy java spring system. We are however tasked with implementing a feedback service for collecting and storing user feedback.

## Overview

The web client is a react web app. The web app communicates with the backend which is build from a micro services architecture. The composition of the services are managed by docker-compose.

The food-service retrieves data about the foods which are stored in a JSON file. The service exposes a REST api for querying the food data. 

The feedback service stores feedback in a sqlite database. The service exposes a REST API which is implemented in Express.JS.
